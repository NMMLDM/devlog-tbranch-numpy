   * Got Brian's BulkIO to compile and run with a simple macro. Picked four ROOT TTrees to use for testing: two flat ntuples and two with variable-length lists.
   * Wrote a [project scope document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fTEULp2MkyGsiLZoKrang-QB4H_MjEqqI-VzbJJn9Bo/edit?usp=sharing)  ("book" icon at the top of this page).
